 Loops
Most languages have the concept of loops: If we want to repeat a task twenty times, we don't want to have to type in the 

code twenty times, with maybe a slight change each time.

As a result, we have for and while loops in the Bourne shell. This is somewhat fewer features than other languages, 

but nobody claimed that shell programming has the power of C.


For Loops

for loops iterate through a set of values until the list is exhausted
